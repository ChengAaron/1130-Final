# Constructing an Amusement Park in New York City
## Business Motivation
New York City has several amusement parks, including Coney Island’s Luna Park in Brooklyn. However, many are old and lack the thrilling rides we aim to introduce. We propose building a new, world-class amusement park in NYC, comparable to Canada’s Wonderland and Six Flags.

With COVID-19 restrictions lifted, people are eager for outdoor activities. NYC, with a population density of 29,729 people per square mile and an average household income of $102,946, is an ideal location. As a top tourist destination, NYC hosted 66.6 million visitors in 2019, spending $3.3 billion. Although tourism dropped to 22.3 million in 2020, projections indicate a rebound to over 70 million visitors by 2025.

Since we are creating a tourist attraction, we can use airbnb data in NYC to find the most optimal place to construct an amusment park. Airbnbs are usually a cheaper alternative to hotels so we will be analyzing a lot of data based on airbnbs in each borough. This will give an additional location for tourists to visit while they are in NYC.

## Conclusion
We decided to build our theme park near the Brooklyn Navy Yard for several reasons. This area meets the demographics and characteristics we sought and is conveniently located near Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan. This ensures accessibility from three key areas with high populations and sufficient disposable income. Addtionally, it is also a historic location with a great view of Manhattan.

We initially considered a location near JFK airport but found it would cut off key customers from Manhattan and face construction challenges due to density and regulations. Therefore, the Brooklyn Navy Yard emerged as the ideal location for our amusement park.
